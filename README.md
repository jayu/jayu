### Hi code detectives 🕵️

I'm Jakub, software engineer changing the World using TypeScript, React and Node 🌍!

My journey started several years ago while I was trying to figure out how to add animation on the web page 🌱

I stayed around for a while, and now I'm building [codeque.co](https://codeque.co) - structural code search and replace tool 🔍

I also built or contributed to a few other cool projects 👇
